# Tennessee How to Update IDs
## Summary
First, you need to get your [name changed](TN-NameChange.md).

After that, you'll want to update your Social Security card and get a passport whether you need one or not. After that, you can use those documents to update all of your other documents.

## Social Security Information
This is actually pretty easy to do.
* You'll need [form SS-5](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf).
* Fill out the form and bring in your required documentation along with your name change court order.
* Arrive early to the Social Security office or pick a less crowded one in a nearby city.

## Passport
### Summary
Once you have your updated Social Security card, the next document to get is your passport. United States passports currently let you specify your own gender marker. I do recommend getting a passport card as well as a normal passport.

A lot of passport locations require that you schedule an appointment, but there are some small county clerk offices which allow people to bring in their passport documents at any point.

### Passport Photo
Places like CVS, Walgreens, and even the UPS Store can do passport photos which will meet official requirements.

### Costs
[Passport costs](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html):
* Passport book: $130 for adults and $100 for minors
* Passport card: $30 for adults and $15 for minors
* Passport book and card: $160 for adults and $115 for minors
* Expedited processing: $60 per application for faster processing

There is also the Execution (Acceptance) Fee. This is a $35 per application fee which is separate from the other passport fees. This fee is payable directly to the passport office you submit through.

### How to pay
For the passport book, card, and expedited processing fee you submit a check (personal, certified, cashier's, traveler's) or money order payable to "U.S. Department of State"

For the Execution (Acceptance) Fee it depends on the agency. You may need to pay by money order or personal check. Credit cards may also be accepted by depending on the location.

## Driver's License
While you cannot officially change your gender marker on your driver's license by law, there have been reports of individuals using their updated passport gender marker as a way of getting their driver's license changed. Do not rely on this.

​An official court order of name change must be provided at the DMV in order to update your name on a driver’s license. 

Fees: $16

Documents needed:
* Official court order for name change
* Social Security Card (Updated)
* Current driver’s license
* [Tennessee Proof of Residency documents](https://www.tn.gov/safety/driver-services/classd/tnresidency.html)

Note: They'll also offer to update your information for your voter's registration. Go ahead and do this, but you may run into a situation where the county election board contacts you due to confusion with two records having the same social security number.

## Birth Certificate
If you were born in Tennessee, you'll need to download the [Application to Amend A Tennessee Birth Record](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/vital-records/PH-1186-Application-to-Amend-A-Tennessee-Birth-Record.pdf). This form does require items be notarized so please seek a local notary public.

There is an information page included with the form that explains what documentation is needed, but it's a bit convoluted. Feel free to contact the Office of Vital Records if you have any questions on what they need.

Please note, there is a line where it says this is not for legal name changes. That is correct, but you're not using this to legally change your name, that was done via a court order already. This is just updating your birth certificate as a result of your court order.

Fees:
* Submitting the application to amend: $15
* Obtaining a new copy of your birth certificate: $15

The office of Vital Records prefers that you submit forms via mail. Here is the [Office of Vital Records website](https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/vital-records.html) for contact information.
