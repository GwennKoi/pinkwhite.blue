# Tennessee Name Change

## Summary
The procedure depends on your county. Some counties have a form that goes through the county clerk's office and others require you to make your own court petition as well as court order for the judge to sign. You'll need to check with your local county clerk and chancery court to see which way they do it.

## Fees
The court fee for a name change ranges between $150 and $300.

If you're unable to afford the court fees, try filling out the [Uniform Civil Affidavit of Indigency](https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/uniform_civil_affidavit_of_indigency.pdf) to see if the court will let you file anyway.

## Documents
When filing, you will need to provide the appropriate information from the [Tennessee Proof of Residency](https://www.tn.gov/safety/driver-services/classd/tnresidency.html) documents list. This is to let them know you are who you say you are.

## Courtroom Information (if needed)
If you're required to appear before the judge, they will ask you to confirm that you are who you say you are, that you are changing your name to the one as listed in the document, and confirm you are not doing this to avoid debt, avoid the law, or in order to commit fraud. Then they will sign the court order. They may also require that you also sign the court order so be prepared to sign with your new signature. Practicing your new signature ahead of time avoids any awkward moments.

## Court Clerk and Getting Copies
The court order will be available shortly after the court finishes its business. Check with the court clerk's office afterward to find out how soon you can get a copy of the documents.

You will need to pay for official copies of the court order. These usually run $7 - $15 each and you will need several for getting other documents changed later. Check for exact prices with the court clerk's office ahead of time as well as what payment methods they accept.
